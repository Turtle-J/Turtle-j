    She's a good singer, rapper, emcee, and planner.
    If you search her on the Youtube, I'm sure that you wiil be surprised and fall in love with her.
    She started her job at internet cafe with named Jagyum. Nowadays, her abilities've been recognized from a lot of people.

      And she and her fandom's relationship is pretty special. You can be surprised and think it's kind of awkward.
      Because their relationship is not really normal. They cheer each other of course, but at the same time, they tease and show weired behavior like real friends.
      It was really awkward to me at first also. So, I just thought, "what the hell is it...?
      Is it okay to tell her fan like this? I cannot believe it. I've never seen this situation before in any fandom that I've been, and heard."
      But, a few days later, I just got used to it, and I love it now. It's really fun and I can feel more close to her.
